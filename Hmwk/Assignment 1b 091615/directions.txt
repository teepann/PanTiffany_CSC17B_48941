Review some console app code for Qt

https://github.com/ml1150258/LehrMark_CSC17B_48941/tree/master/Class

Create a 2-Dim Dynamic Array

1) Create a class with the following properties

     a) int nRows

     b) int nCols

     c) int **array

2) Include the following behaviors

     a) constructor Array(int,int) which has 2 parameters the number of rows and cols for the 2 D array.

     b) a char * toString() behavior which returns a string with the contents of the array in character array format

     c) create a destructor to deallocate memory.

     Note:  Fill the array in the constructor with random 2 digit numbers.

3) We created a hello world program with Qt.  See the attachment.  You are to use the Class created from 1) and 2)

to use in the Hello World Qt program.  

4) Create a GUI Hello World Program and Populate the label with the String that you can create from an object instantiated

above.
